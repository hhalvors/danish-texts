"""Resolve a book to the scan it was transcribed from, and prove it is that scan.

WHY THIS EXISTS, AND WHY IT IS NOT A NAMING CONVENTION

~/bibliotek is a 17 GB general-purpose philosophy library: 1285 PDFs in 513
author folders, serving several projects, of which danish-texts uses about 72.
Renaming it to suit this one consumer would be a large destructive change to a
shared resource, and it would still not prevent the failure that matters.

The failure that matters is not a bad name. It is a scan being silently replaced
by a different printing. Every `\\opage{N}` in a transcription encodes an offset
into one specific PDF; substitute another edition and every page marker in the
book is quietly wrong, with nothing to detect it. A naming convention cannot
catch that. A content hash catches it exactly.

So identity here is the sha256 of the file, and the path is only an address.
That inverts the usual bargain in a useful way: uniform names PREVENT breakage
by discipline, and must be maintained forever by everyone; content hashes
TOLERATE breakage, so the library can be reorganised however its owner likes and
`verify` simply re-finds everything. Re-find is cheap because a moved file keeps
its byte size: stat every PDF (instant), hash only the size matches.

  python3 scans.py path <book>     absolute path, verified; non-zero exit if not
  python3 scans.py verify [book…]  OK / MOVED / CHANGED / MISSING / UNRESOLVED
  python3 scans.py update          rewrite SCANS.tsv paths for MOVED files
  python3 scans.py rehash <book> <path>   record a newly identified scan

A CHANGED result is never routine. It means the bytes behind an edition moved
under it. Before accepting one, establish whether the page count and page size
still match: a re-OCR or re-compression of the same scan is benign and only
needs the hash updated; a different printing invalidates the book's page map and
every marker in it.
